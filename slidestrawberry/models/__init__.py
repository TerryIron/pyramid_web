    Get a ``sqlalchemy.orm.Session`` instance backed by a transaction.

    This function will hook the session to the transaction manager which
    will take care of committing any changes.

    - When using pyramid_tm it will automatically be committed or aborted
      depending on whether an exception is raised.

    - When using scripts you should wrap the session in a manager yourself.
      For example::

          import transaction

          engine = get_engine(settings)
